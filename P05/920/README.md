##### The process

##### Read from a file the number of cases, and the number of points per case.
##### Store these items in a vector of structs.
##### Sort the vector based on x coordinates.
##### Begin calculating the sunny side by using euclidean distance, subtracting the previous max Y, and adding to the total.
##### Last is to print, making sure to use exactly 2 decimal places.
